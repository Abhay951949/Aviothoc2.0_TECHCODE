## 🚩 Problem Addressed & Proposed Solution

### Problem:
Losing personal belongings in public places such as campuses, offices, or public transport is a common issue. Traditional methods like posters or word-of-mouth announcements are inefficient, unorganized, and lack reach.

### Proposed Solution:
The **Lost and Found Portal** offers a centralized online platform where users can:
- Report lost or found items quickly.  
- Browse or search through listed items by category, date, or location.  
- Contact the person who found or lost an item securely through the platform.
